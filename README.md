# VoiceIdentification

This program requires the users' voice as an audio input in order to run. The user may upload a media file ending in .wav or use the microphone button on the GUI. The input will then be analyzed and compared to a stored database of voices. This comparison will return a boolean value and will be displayed on the GUI to the user.
